# Gjallarhorn

Gjallarhorn is a small, lightweight framework for managing mutable state when notifications are required.

It is designed and written in F#, and has the following goals:

* Wrap mutable data in the lightest weight manner possible
* Allow tracking of changes to the data
* Provide a functional API for working with the resulting data
* Integrating with other reactive systems, such as FSharp.Control.Reactive
* Adapt easily to INotifyPropertyChanged and similar mechanisms for notification of changes
